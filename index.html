        <h2>SPICY SAUSAGE BALLS</h2>

        <p>These spicy sausage balls come together with nothing more than cheddar, cream cheese, sausage, and bisquick! Make them ahead of time and keep them warm in the Crock Pot!

         Be sure to serve these with a side of honey mustard sauce!</P>

        <p>These 3-ingredient sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser, whether you serve them as a breakfast or brunch treat, a party appetizer, a game-day nibble, or a holiday hors d'oeuvre. Savory sausage, store-bought biscuit mix, and sharp Cheddar cheese team up for savory, cheesy flavor that can't be beat. These are so yummy! My family makes every Christmas morning.</p>

        <p>These are the go-to snack in my house for playdates, parties or just an afternoon indulgence. It is quick to make and basically just needs three ingredients – sausage, cheese and Bisquick Baking Mix. Everything else is a personal choice. I even make this for breakfast as it is simple and filling and have even replaced meatballs in spaghetti with these on occasion.</p>


        <h3><INGREDIENT LIST.></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>1 pound ground spicy pork sausage.</p></li>
                <li><p>2 cups Bisquick baking mix.</p></li>
                <li><p>2 cups of freshly shredded sharp cheddar cheese.</p></li>
                <li><p>2 tablespoons of chives finely chopped.</p></li>
                <li><p>½ teaspoon garlic powder.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>STEPS ON HOW TO MAKE SPICY SAUSAGE BALLS.</h4>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</p></li>
                <li><p>If you have a stand mixer with a metal (not plastic) paddle attachment, the mixing will take less time. Place all the ingredients in your mixer bowl and combine on “Stir” or “1” (low setting) until all the ingredients are combined and moistened.</p></li>
                <li><p>If you do not have a stand mixer, use your hands to combine all the ingredients together until the mixture is moistened. Feel free to use disposable gloves.</p></li>
                <li><p>Form the mixture into 1 ½” balls and place each sausage ball about 2” apart on the baking sheets. *I used a #24 disher with the red handle. It’s approximately 1 ½ ounces, 2” in diameter. Very handy for forming uniform sausage balls.</p></li>
                <li><p>Bake one or both baking sheets, depending on your oven space, for 20 to 25 minutes. If you want more browning, bake for 20 minutes then broil for 1-3 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Remove from the oven and carefully place the meatballs on a paper towel-lined plate/platter to absorb grease.</p></li>                                                                                                                    
                <li><p>Remove from the oven and carefully place the meatballs on a paper towel-lined plate/platter to absorb grease.</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h4><b>NOTE</b></h4>
            
            <ul>
               <p>Hot pepper cheeses… I used a blend of Habanero cheddar and Hatch Chile Gouda. You can use Pepper-Jack cheese here instead; I know it’s more readily available.</p>
               <p>I love my Five Pepper Seasoning and Rub by Pepper Palace. I put it on roasted veggies, marinades, meat rubs, casseroles, dips, etc. It can be found in the Pepper Palace specialty stores. I stock up when we’re able to visit a store while on vacation.</p>
               <p>Combining room temperature sausage will allow the mixture to come together easier.</p>
               <p>Sour cream is added for moisture resulting in moist sausage balls. You can omit the sour cream altogether if you prefer. I personally like it</p>
               <p>Most people use breakfast sausage for sausage balls, but if you’ve learned from my previous posts and emails, I don’t always stick with the traditional. You are welcome to use it, though, in place of the Italian sausage.</p>
               <p>The Nutrition Chart shows information from the ingredients that I used. If you switch up cheeses, sausage, and/or seasonings (especially salt), and you need a more accurate chart, you’ll need to calculate for your ingredients.</p>
